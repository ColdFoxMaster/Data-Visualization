BARRA_LATERAL = "In a supply chain context, we have 5 separate processes.\n\nIn this visualization project, we are focusing on the delivery process, as it is the process that generates revenue directly.\n\nThis is an analysis on a superstore sales dataset located in the US.\n\nThe map on the right shows the states that bought more products of a certain sub-category."
SALES_PROFIT = "In the bar chart below, we can see the relationship between sales and profit generated by the company, for the various product sub-categories. Since a company can have revenue without making any profit, but cannot have profit without any revenue, it is important to understand this relationship in order to optimize this ratio by maximizing profit."
YEAR_PROFIT = "With the line graph presented below, we intend to establish a temporal relationship with the variation of the profit obtained by the 3 categories addressed, in the last 4 years of operation. Like this, it will be possible to perceive that the strategy applied by the company over the last few years has provided an increase in profitability.\n"
SUNBURST = "Below, we have a sunburst with the representation by category and, subsequently, sub-category of products, of the total amount, in dollars, of discount applied, which in turn is a reduced amount of the total of a purchase, for example, as a benefit to the payment method or promotion.\n"
CLIENT_BEHAVIOUR = "In this section, emphasis is placed on the three classes of clients that the company presents: Consumer, Corporate and Home Office. \nThroughout the project, we considered profit as the most important metric in evaluating Superstore’s performance. For this very reason, below are two representations which allow us to associate this same profit with the different client profiles."
STACKED_BARCHART = "The stacked bar chart below allows us to visualize the previously mentioned relationship, sorted by the revenue of product categories purchased by each of these client classes.\n"
PIE_CHART = "One last important step, this pie chart allows us to better visualize what each client class represents in terms of gross monetary sales profit for the retail company in this dataset.\n"
MAP = "The map on the right shows the volume of purchases of a certain category of product, which can be selected with the radio button below.\n\n"
