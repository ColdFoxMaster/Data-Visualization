BARRA_LATERAL = "In a supply chain context, we have 5 separate processes. In this visualization project, we are focusing on the delivery process, as it is the process that generates revenue directly. This is an analysis on a superstore sales dataset located in the US. The map on the right shows the states that bought more products of a certain sub-category."
SALES_PROFIT = "In the bar chart below, we can see the relationship between sales and profit generated by the company, for the various product sub-categories. Since a company can have revenue without making any profit, but cannot have profit without any revenue, it is important to understand this relationship in order to optimize this ratio by maximizing profit."
YEAR_PROFIT = "Through the line graph presented below, we intend to establish a temporal relationship with the variation of the profit obtained by the 3 categories addressed, in the last 4 years of operation. In this way, it will be possible to perceive the strategy applied by the company over the last few years, has provided an increase in profitability."
SUNBURST = "Below, we have a sunburst with the representation by category and, subsequently, sub-category of products, of the total amount, in dollars, of discount applied, which in turn is a reduced amount of the total of a purchase, for example, as a benefit to the payment method or promotion."
CLIENT_BEHAVIOUR = "In this section, emphasis is placed on the three classes of customers that the company presents: Consumer, Corporate and Home Office. \n Throughout the project, we considered profit as the most important metric in evaluating Superstoreâ€™s performance. For this very reason, below are two representations which allow us to associate this same profit with the different customer profiles."
STACKED_BARCHART = "This stacked bar chart represented below, allows us to visualize the previously mentioned relationship, along with the share of the product category purchased by each of these customer clusters."
PIE_CHART = "Finally, this pie chart allows us to better visualize what each customer class represents, in terms of gross profit, for the company."
